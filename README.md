# deep-learning-traffic-signs
A deep learning project that classifies traffic signs using the GTSRB dataset and a CNN built with TensorFlow. Trained on 50K+ images across 43 classes, the model supports real-time recognition for autonomous driving applications. Future work includes YOLO-based detection and multilingual OCR integration.
